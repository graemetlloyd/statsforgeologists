## An introductory statistics course for geologists

### Graeme T. Lloyd

## Introduction

This repository contains materials (lectures, practicals and formative and summative assessments) for teaching introductory statistics to geologists. Aside from basic "standard" statistics (univariate, bivarate, multivariate) the reposotiory also includes some more specific to geology that might be less relevant to other sciences (e.g., circular statistics, plotting stereonets).

These materials are released under a GNU General Public License Version 3 (see LICENSE for details) with the exception of material reused from other sources. Specifically:

* Volcano data ([NOAA Volcano Location Database](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/dataset/global-volcano-locations-database))
* Meteor impact ages ([Earth Impact Database](http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/New%20website_05-2018/Index.html))
* Dinosaur body mass data ([Dryad repositiory for Benson et al. 2018](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1t3r4))

## Format

The course asssumes a standard structure of Lecture + Practical + Formative Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ; with Model Answers), with eight lectures total. However, an additional opening practical and MCQ also cover a basic introduction to the programming language R and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) ([RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)) - the freely available, multiplatform software on which the practicals are based (and which students can easily install on their personal machines). The practicals use a variety of geologic example data sets, but are primarily based around an ammonite quadrat (see below) which serves as a training data set for the summative assessment (writing a scientific paper-style report on a different ammonite quadrat from higher in the saem geologic sequence).
